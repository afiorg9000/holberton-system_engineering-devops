On April 26, 2022, from 3:20 pm till 10:00 pm, Instagram went down because of a faulty configuration change on its backbone routers. Instagram wasn't loading for 100,000 users. On the desktop version of Instagram, the webpage loaded to a “5xx server error”. Configuration changes on the backbone routers that coordinate network traffic between the data centers caused issues that interrupted this communication. This disruption to network traffic had a cascading effect on how the data centers communicate, bringing their services to a halt. The issue was detected by an increase of malfunction reports on Downdetector. The assumption on the root case was based on recent updates Instagram had made to their configuration system, which was then investigated and confirmed. The incident was resolved by making some changes to specific configuration files on the routers. This system could potentially be improved through testing within the network traffic.
